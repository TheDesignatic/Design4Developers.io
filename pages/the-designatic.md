*The Foundation* is my first theme which I let into the world. It's built on work and knowledge of others. While I am still designing it, you read about whats behind this theme in the – *hopefully* – near future.

## Background

* 25 Years as a Java Coder
* 25 Years as someone fascinated by Human Experience
* 



## I got inspired by...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2]. Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002. [GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide. [Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress. And many, many more...

Please make *Feeling Responsive* yours and if you like it, please link back to my homebase <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. That would be awesome.

#### Since then, fork it!

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][7]
